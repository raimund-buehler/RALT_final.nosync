# General

This repo contains all files and analyses scripts for the RSOS submission "Autistic Traits relate to reduced Reward Sensitivity in Learning from Social Point-Light Displays (PLDâ€™s)".
The analysis is split into several folders:

## RL_parameter_fit

This folder contains all subject data and custom python scripts to fit the Rescorla-Wagner model to the choice data and to obtain parameter values described in the manuscript.
The most important script is "read_data.py" where participant data is read in and parameters are fit for each subject using negative log-likelihood and several helper functions 
defined in other files. These are then saved as best_params_df.csv and analyzed further

## parameter_analysis
This folder contains the main analysis of paramaters. The most important file is "glmmTMB.r", where the beta-GLM models are fit and analyzed. 
The main results can be replicated using this file, but several older files for analysis are also included in this folder.

## plot_choice_vs_predict
